# credit-risk-classification
Overview

The purpose of this credit risk analysis is to build a machine learning model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers based on historical lending activity data from a peer-to-peer lending services company. The primary goal is to assist the company in making informed lending decisions and effectively managing credit risk.

The Results

The machine learning model was built using logistic regression on the original data, and its performance was evaluated using various metrics.

Accuracy Score: 0.99
Precision Score: 0.86
Recall Score: 0.91

Summary

The credit risk analysis results show a highly accurate and reliable machine learning model. The model achieved an accuracy score of 0.99, indicating that it correctly classified 99% of the loans into their own categories of healthy (0) and high-risk (1). The precision score of 0.86 shows that the model accurately identified 86% of the high-risk loans out of all loans predicted as high-risk. This means that the model effectively identifies a significant portion of the high-risk loans. The recall score of 0.91 reveals that the model correctly identified 91% of the actual high-risk loans. This demonstrates the model's ability to effectively capture most of the high-risk loans present in the dataset. The high accuracy, precision, and recall scores ensure that it can really enhance the company's ability to make data-driven lending decisions and identify high-risk borrowers accurately.
